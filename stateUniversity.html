            <h1>Evolution of State Universities in India</h1>
            <p>The history of state universities in India dates back to the early 20th century when the first state university, the University of Mysore, was established in 1916. The establishment of state universities was a result of the Indian Education Commission of 1882, which recommended the decentralization of education. The state universities were set up by the state governments to provide affordable and quality education to the students in their respective states. The state universities initially started as affiliating universities and later on started offering their own courses. Today, there are over 400 state universities in India, offering courses in various streams, including arts, science, commerce, engineering, law, medicine, and agriculture. These universities have played a significant role in the growth and development of higher education in the country, producing a large number of graduates who have contributed to the nation's progress.

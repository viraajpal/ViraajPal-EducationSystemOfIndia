            <h1>Evolution of Education System in India</h1><p>
                The education system in India has evolved over the years, with
                significant changes taking place at different points in time. After
                independence in 1947, the Indian government made significant efforts
                to expand access to education, particularly at the primary and
                secondary levels. A number of policies were introduced to improve the
                quality of education, including the National Policy on Education in
                1986 and the subsequent revision in 1992. These policies emphasized
                the importance of equity, quality, and access in education, and
                focused on expanding the reach of education to remote and
                disadvantaged areas. More recently, the Indian government has
                introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving the quality of
                higher education in the country, including the establishment of new
                institutions of national importance, such as the Indian Institutes of
                Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), as
                well as the introduction of new regulatory bodies, such as the
                National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC) and the National
                Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF). Despite these efforts,
                challenges remain, issues related to access, equity, and quality,
                particularly in rural and remote areas.

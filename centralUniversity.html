            <h1>Evolution of Central Universities in India</h1>
            <p>Central Universities in India have evolved
                significantly since the establishment of the University of
                Calcutta, the first modern university in India, in 1857. Following the University of Calcutta,
                universities were established in other cities such as Bombay, Madras, and Allahabad in the late 19th and
                early 20th centuries. The first Central University, the University of Delhi, was established in 1922 to
                provide education at the national level. After independence in 1947, more Central Universities were
                established to cater to the needs of the newly-formed nation. Today, there are 51 Central Universities
                in India that are funded and regulated by the Government of India. These universities offer a wide range
                of academic programs in various fields, including science, arts, humanities, engineering, and
                management. Central Universities have played a significant role in shaping the education system in India
                and have produced many renowned scholars, scientists, and leaders who have contributed to the nation's
                development.
                The region with the most central universities in India is Delhi with seven universities. There are
                central universities in all of the states of India except Goa. Of the union territories, there are
                central universities in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry.
